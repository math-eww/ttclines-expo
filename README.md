# TTCLines

### TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) map view for surface route vehicle tracking and estimated next departure times app built with React Native and Expo

#### Major features include:
- map view centered on user location showing all nearby surface route stops
- click on stops in map view to open popup showing estimated next vehicle arrival times
- track vehicles as they move across their routes

## Project Status

Had some extra time recently to rewrite the entire app using React Native and Expo (see my old TTC Lines repo for the Android only Java version).  This is my first app using RN and Expo, it was a good learning experience but I'm sure it could be improved.

### How Can I Help?

I'm sure the app code could use some updates, and some beautifying. Feel free to contribute by updating the app code itself.  Pull requests are welcome :).
